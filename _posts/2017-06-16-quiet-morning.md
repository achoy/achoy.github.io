```On a quiet summer morning,
when the birds whisper their stories,
The wind waves the branches and leaves around,
The sun filters her light through the window shutters
I wonder where I’ve been,

Work - projects - for a living, these 30 years,
At last, I learn to move as a bushido,
practice waza (hero), yellow belts, and the determined.
my mind is young, yet my body creaks and groans.
Inexorably, I go on.

Imaginatio, xiangxiangli, sozo-ryoku, verbeelding,
Whatever tongue it is expressed as,
drives me to a place, a metropolis in my mind’s eye.
where my characters tells me what they want and need,
and I counsel them to play nice, take turns, and show.

On this quiet, windy morning,
I write. I sing. I dream.
