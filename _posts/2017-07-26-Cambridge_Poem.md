By Xu Zhimo  

Softly I am leaving,  
Just as softly as I came;  
I softly wave goodbye  
To the clouds in the western sky.  

The golden willows by the riverside  
Are young brides in the setting sun;  
Their glittering reflections on the shimmering river  
Keep undulating in my heart.  

The green tape grass rooted in the soft mud  
Sways leisurely in the water;  
I am willing to be such a waterweed  
In the gentle flow of the River Cam.  

That pool in the shade of elm trees  
Holds not clear spring water, but a rainbow  
Crumpled in the midst of duckweeds,  
Where rainbow-like dreams settle.  

To seek a dream? Go punting with a long pole,  
Upstream to where green grass is greener,  
With the punt laden with starlight,  
And sing out loud in its radiance.  

Yet now I cannot sing out loud,  
Peace is my farewell music;  
Even crickets are now silent for me,  
For Cambridge this evening is silent.  

Quietly I am leaving,  
Just as quietly as I came;  
Gently waving my sleeve,  
I am not taking away a single cloud.  

(6 November 1928)
