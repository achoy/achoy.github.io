    Round like a circle in a spiral,
    like a wheel within a wheel
    Never ending or beginning on an
    ever spinning reel
    Like a snowball down a mountain,
    or a carnival balloon
    Like a carousel that's turning
    running rings around the moon
    Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
    And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
    Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind
