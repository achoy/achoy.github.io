    Round like a circle in a spiral,
    like a wheel within a wheel
    Never ending or beginning on an
    ever spinning reel
    Like a snowball down a mountain,
    or a carnival balloon
    Like a carousel that's turning
    running rings around the moon
    Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
    And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
    Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind

    Like a tunnel that you follow
    To a tunnel of its own
    Down a hollow to a cavern
    Where the sun has never shone
    Like a door that keeps revolving
    In a half-forgotten dream
    Or the ripples from a pebble
    Someone tosses in a stream
    Like a clock whose hands are sweeping
    Past the minutes of its face
    And the world is like an apple
    Whirling silently in space
    Like the circles that you find
    In the windmills of your mind

    Keys that jingle in your pocket
    Words that jangle in your head
    Why did summer go so quickly?
    Was it something that you said?
    Lovers walk along a shore
    And leave their footprints in the sand
    Is the sound of distant drumming
    Just the fingers of your hand?
    Pictures hanging in a hallway
    And the fragment of a song
    Half-remembered names and faces
    But to whome do they belong?
    When you knew that it was over
    You were suddenly aware
    That the autumn leaves were turning
    To the color of her hair

    Like a circle in a spiral
    Like a wheel within a wheel
    Never ending or beginning
    On an ever-spinning reel
    As the images unwind
    Like the circles that you find
    In the windmills of your mind

Songwriters: Alan Bergman / Marylin Bergman / Michel Legrand
