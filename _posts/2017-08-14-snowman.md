   I always wanted to build a snowman. 
   From my birthplace in the sweltering tropics,
   to my middle childhood in the temperate bay of Tampa,
   I fantasize about the shaping of a white billowy guardian in my front yard. 
   Snow could not be found however, except as light watery dust in the freezer
   or as snowflake creatures hiding in the telly.

   To my great surprise, I find myself building a home in the wintery, frozen tundra of Minnesota. 
   Here it gets so cold that for months, you can drive your car across the tranquil,
   flowy yet solid surfaces of some lakes. And yet, I have still not built my snowman.

   He beckons in my mind, with his stiff pointy nose, and a beady smile made from little round stones,
   and his outstretched branch of a hand, to make him real. 
   Next winter, I tell him, I will form balls of snow into an amazing girth,
   my kids piling large clumps of frozen water into the shape of a perfect snowman,
   and I’ll call him... Sam.

   Time ticks away.  I dream of imaginary children walking with me down the hill to the quiet valley
   where my snowman waits... for the perfect moment... to be real.
